# Mass Mailing

This code will help you send Email Campaigns through Gmail by automating the work of copying email addresses and changing to different account when the daily quota of a mail id is reached.

## Setting up the project

-   Clone the repo in your local computer
-   Add your HTML code of Digital Mailer in the file `mailer.py` in place of `ADD YOUR MAILER HERE`
-   Add an Alternative text mailer in case someone has not allowed HTML in their Gmail in place `ADD ALTERNATIVE HERE`
