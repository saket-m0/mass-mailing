# Mass Mailing

This code will help you send Email Campaigns through Gmail by automating the work of copying email addresses and changing to different account when the daily quota of a mail id is reached.

## Setting up the project

-   Clone the repo in your local computer
-   Add an excel file named `MailingList` in the same folder
-   Add column named `Email Addresses` in the excel sheet and all the mail ids in the column
